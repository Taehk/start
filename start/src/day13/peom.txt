Stronger than You

This is Garnet
Back together
And I'm never going down at the hands of the likes of you
Because I'm so much better
And every part of me is saying "go get her"
The two of us ain't gonna follow your rules
Come at me without any of your fancy tools
Let's go, just me and you
Let's go, just one on two
Go ahead and try and hit me if you're able
Can't you see that my relationship is stable?
I can see you hate the way we intermingle
But I think you're just mad 'cause you're single
And you're not gonna stop what we made together
We are gonna stay like this forever
If you break us apart we'll just come back newer
And we'll always be twice the gem that you are
I am made o-o-o-o-of
Lo-o-o-o-ove
O-o-o-o-of
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
